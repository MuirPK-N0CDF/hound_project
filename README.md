#The Hound Project
This project contains all the cad files for a modular Amateur Radio Direction Finding antenna. Antenna components will eventually be available for a range of different bands, from HF small loop antennas through VHF/UHF yagis. 

In another project, I will work on a Raspberry Pi / RTL-SDR dongle combo that will provide a nice built-in reciever and UI for the device. I may potentially add a webserver so the live I/Q and/or audio feed can be transmitted to the user's device for a better, browser-based UI and better processing.

I am testing the antenna with a HackRF One, RTL-SDR, BaoFeng GT-5R, FT-60, and a Nano VNA for tuning. I advise you obtain an antenna analyzer of some type and use it to tune the antenna before you transmit. 



If you make an improvement to my design or code, share it. If you write code for a different microcontroller, or build a frame for a different radio, let me know or make your own repo. Contact me and I may link it. If you want it added here, I can do that too.

Amateur radio operators and/or clubs: print as many of my devices as you see fit. If you build these devices, please use them. Get the local scouts or a church youth group involved, or start a club at the local high school. Spread the love of radio to your community.
